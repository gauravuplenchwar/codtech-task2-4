Overview of project:
project: OPTIMIZATION MODEL:
*CODE OPTIMIZATION IN COMPILER DESIGN:

1.Dead Code Elimination: 
~Copy propagation often leads to making assignment statements into dead code.
~A variable is said to be dead if it is never used after its last definition.
~In order to find the dead variables, a data flow analysis should be done.

2.Unreachable Code Elimination: 
~First, Control Flow Graph should be constructed.
~The block which does not have an incoming edge is an Unreachable code block.
~After constant propagation and constant folding, the unreachable branches can be eliminated.

3.Function Inlining: 
~Here, a function call is replaced by the body of the function itself.
~This saves a lot of time in copying all the parameters, storing the return address, etc.

4. Function Cloning: 
~Here, specialized codes for a function are created for different calling parameters.
~Example: Function Overloading.
